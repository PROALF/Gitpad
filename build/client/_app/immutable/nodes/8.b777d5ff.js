## Privacy

<em>Last updated: September 15, 2023</em>

No conversations are recorded. All computation happens on your device, and conversations are stored locally in the browser’s cache.

We don’t and never will see your data, so we cannot train on your data. Your data remains yours.

## About

BlindChat is an open-source project to provide fully in-browser and private Conversational AI.

It is currently developed and maintained by [Mithril Security](https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/), a startup aiming to make AI more private.

You can find more information on our [Github](https://github.com/mithril-security/blind_chat/), join us on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TxEHagpWd4), or directly [contact us](mailto:contact@mithrilsecurity.io).
